# Shaders
Shaders I made in [Shader Editor (Android)](https://github.com/markusfisch/ShaderEditor)

I also port them to [Drastic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsemu.drastic) if their effect will work well with it.

# Installing the Drastic shaders
Extract the .dfx and .dsd files into the Drastic/shaders/ folder. The Drastic folder should be in your internal storage.
After that, you can select them in the Video settings of Drastic with the Filter option.
